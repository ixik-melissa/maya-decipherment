# Ways of contribution
Your input is more than welcome! Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent 
as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting problems
* Discussing the current state of the document
* Suggesting changes
* Proposing new parts, be it chapters, sections or small additions.

## Developing with GitHub
This project uses GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, utilize pull requests
to ensure reviews and continuous integration.

## Releases
The document itself will never really be completed as the decipherment is an ongoing 
process with no foreseeable ending.
Therefore, there will be a continuous stream of releases once in a while.
Please see chapter [Release](documentation/releases.md)
for some more detailed information.

## All changes happen through pull requests (PR)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.
Please see chapter [Continuous Integration](documentation/continuous-integration.md)
for some more detailed information.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same 
[MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. 
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report problems and suggestions
This project use issues to track public problems/suggestions. 
Report a problem/suggestion by 
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/ixik-melissa/maya-decipherment/issues).
It's that easy!
The project distinguishes between `Bug` and `Suggestion`.

A bug is some kind of infrastructure problem - not related to the content of the document.
Infrastructure can cover LaTeX specifics or PowerShell problems, automatization or virtualization 
issues to name a few.

A suggestion addresses the content of the document directly.
Please use this type to report mistakes, errors, but also improvements, additions etc.

## Write issues for suggestions in detail, with background and sources
A good report should include the following things:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Please refer to the chapter or TeX file you'd like to address.
* Cite the section which should be changed.
* Reason about the changes you'd like to see
* Add a possible suggestion which might include:
    * A rephrasing of the section. Maybe you can rewrite some parts to it fits into the document.
    * A citation of a paper/book or any other available scientific source which can back up
      the suggestion or which could be used to be cited in the document.
    * Images or figures for illustration

People *love* thorough reports. I'm not even kidding.
Please use the `Suggestion` template for this kind of request when creating a new issue.

## Consistent coding style
The codebase has only a few rules with respect to coding styles.
* Readability (of the source code) is the most important aspect
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 100 characters per line (exceptions permitted if readability would suffer, e.g. large tables)
Please the chapter [LaTeX](documentation/latex.md) for more information.

## In-depth documentation
Everything documentation is located in the folder [documentation](documentation).
