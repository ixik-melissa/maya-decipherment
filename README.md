# The Decipherment of the Maya Hieroglyphs
## Purpose of this project
The Maya hieroglyphs and the Maya script have been a mystery for centuries.
Scholars from all over the world tried to crack the `Mayan Code' since the early 1830s.
But it took many decades until scholars made significant progress in the decipherment until to
this very day.
This process is not complete as roughly 30% of all hieroglyphic signs still elude decipherment 
and even where the signs are linguistically readable, the texts partially elude our 
understanding because Classic Maya has died out.
Yet, the great success of decipherment in the last decades made it possible to read many
texts to such an extent that Mayan history was brought back to life again.
This project has the goal to collect all the breakthroughs in the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs
and illustrate them with examples from all available hieroglyphic sources like the great stela and 
stone inscriptions, the handwritings on pottery or the Maya books etc.

## Basic idea
The basic idea is to write a document which covers as much as possible from the history of 
decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphs.
Every piece of decipherment is backed up and cited with the corresponding scientific paper, book
or article.
The document derived from all the insights from all the scholars from all over the world over
so many decades shall be a good starting point for basically everyone interested in reading
the hieroglyphs and to understand the long process it took to read the writings of the old 
Maya again.
The document should be roughly written in a chronological way.
Since the decipherment process is not a linear process, this won't be possible for everything 
though. 
Sometimes it will make more sense in some parts to jump back and forth in time for 
educational purposes.
But the general guideline (aka rule of thumb) should be, to start from the early stages of 
decipherment until today.

## Releases
All releases of the document can be found 
[here](https://github.com/ixik-melissa/maya-decipherment/releases).
Every release contains the source code the document is based on, a changelog with a description 
of the all changes which have been made and the final document as PDF.
Please see the chapter about [releases](documentation/releases.md) for more information.

## Prerequisites
This project supports all major operating systems: Windows, macOS and Linux.
In order to generate the PDF document from the source code, one needs these components installed
on the system:
* LaTeX (see [LaTeX](#LaTeX) below)
* PowerShell (see [PowerShell](#PowerShell))
    * A platform-independent script language (created by Microsoft) which is used at several places 
    in the code base.
    * An installation guide (from Microsoft) can be found here:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3
* Optional: Inkscape
    * Tool which supports SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) and PDF files
    Only necessary if you'd like to author new graphics, figures etc.

As an alternative, a virtualized environment using Docker containers is also provided.
Please see chapter [Docker](container/Readme.MD) for more information.

### Compiling the document
If the system is set up, open a PowerShell terminal and execute
the provided PowerShell script [Compile-Document.ps1](Compile-Document.ps1) in the root directory
of this project.
The generated PDF document can be found in the `build` folder named `main.pdf` (`build/main.pdf`).

## LaTeX
This project is written in LaTeX - a mark-up language which allows creating big scalable documents 
by writing unformatted text using commands to enrich texts, embed images and tables, cite and 
reference other sources like papers, books and websites scientifically and so on.
That means, a LaTeX environment must be available on your system in order to generally compile 
a PDF document from any given LaTeX source.
For more information on how to set up and use LaTeX, 
please have a look at chapter [LaTeX](documentation/latex.md).

## PowerShell
All scripts are written in PowerShell.
It's a script language created by Microsoft and open-sourced on GitHub: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell.

Since PowerShell is provided for each major platform (that is Windows, macOS and Linux),
it is a good way writing small tools and commands.
Those tools include a straight forward way of compiling documents, managing document versions and
even quality tests.

Each script in this project provides detailed information how it operates and how it can be used.
Getting help for each script can be used with this small command in a PowerShell terminal.

    Get-Help -Full -Name <name of the script file>

Some important scripts are:
* [Compile-Document.ps1](Compile-Document.ps1): Script to compile PDF from given LaTeX source
* [ConvertFrom-Svg.ps1](ConvertFrom-Svg.ps1): Utility script to convert a given SVG file to PDF
* [Test-LaTeXFiles.ps1](Test-LaTeXFiles.ps1): Script to check for LaTeX errors 
  (see [CI](continuous-integration))
* [Test-Document.ps1](Test-Document.ps1): Script to check validity of compiled PDF file
  (see [CI](continuous-integration))
* [Ask-Ajkin.ps1](Ask-Ajkin.ps1): Script which deals with Long Count, Calendar Round and Gregorian dates
* [Edit-DocumentVersion.ps1](Edit-DocumentVersion.ps1): 
  Manages current document version, release version and the next Git tag.
  See also [document-version.tex](document-version.tex).

## Open source
This document is open source which means everybody can work with it, improve it and give feedback.
It should be readable and understandable to anyone interested in this manner.
All texts, images and illustrations should be publicly available, so that the great
process of decipherment can be shared with everyone around the world. 
The project uses the [MIT license](LICENSE) which basically allows everyone to use the code, 
the texts etc. the way they want as long as they credit this project.

## How can I send feedback?
If you find problems within the document of any kind or with the infrastructure of this project, 
please feel free to create issues which address your findings.
This will greatly help to improve the project.
You can create issues on GitHub directly to report problems you have found. 
This requires a GitHub account though.
You can also get in touch via academia.edu 
[here](https://independent.academia.edu/SebastianBauer16).
It should be mentioned that it is preferred that every issue should cover a single problem.
Create issues for each problem separately.
This makes it easier to manage, respond and improve the project incrementally.
For more information about how you can contribute, 
please see the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Source control management
To keep track of all changes being applied to the project, it is useful to have a standard tool 
which allows storing and manage the folder structure and development of the project.
One way to approach this, is to use a Source Code Management(SCM).
It is a tool which allows to maintain the project and keeps track of all the changes 
being applied to it.
[GitHub](github.com) uses GIT for that purpose.
If you want to know more, you can look at some introduction of Atlassian: 
* https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/source-code-management
* https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git

## Trunk-based development and continuous integration
This project also uses a trunk-based development approach.
All changes have to be pushed to the `main` branch in order to be compiled in to the final document.
The process which controls and manages that is called `Continuous Integration`.
Please see [CI](documentation/continuous-integration.md) chapter for more information.

## IDE
VSCode is an Integrated Development Editor(IDE).
It is one way to work with this project.
However, there are many alternatives out there.
Even a basic text editor is enough.
If you would like to know more about VSCode, 
please see the [VSCode](documentation/vscode.md) chapter for more information.

## Docker
This project utilizes Docker to virtualize the LaTeX environment and everything which is needed
to work as a user or author with the project.
It is used by the infrastructure of the continuous integration process.
It can also be used as a so-called Dev Container when being combined with VSCode.
Please see the [Docker](container/README.md) chapter for more information 
about this technology and how it is used.
